# COMP0053_Group6

**This project task is Chronic-Pain Protective Behaviour Detection for the EmoPain Dataset.**
This repository contains the code and pipelines for Early (Feature-Level), Middle (Model-Level), Late (Decision-Level), and Hybrid Fusion Models, as well as cross-validation methods used in our project.
